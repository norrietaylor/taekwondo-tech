- Fix CraftScene camera access error in constructor
- Fix setTint errors on rectangle objects  
- Optimize inventory layout for better part visibility
- Ensure all collected parts fit without scrolling

### Work Completed

#### 🔧 Critical Error Fixes
- **Fixed CraftScene initialization error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'main')`
  - Root cause: Accessing `this.cameras.main` in constructor before Phaser setup complete
  - Solution: Moved camera-dependent layout setup to `setupLayout()` method called from `create()`
  - Now properly initializes responsive layout after cameras are available

#### 🎨 Inventory Layout Optimization
- **Fixed setTint errors**: `icon.setTint is not a function`
  - Root cause: Using `setTint()` on star shapes instead of sprite objects
  - Solution: Replaced `this.add.star()` with `this.add.rectangle()` and used `setFillStyle()`
  - Added proper hover effects with color changes instead of tint

- **Ultra-compact inventory design**:
  - Part size: Reduced from 40px → 35px for maximum density
  - Padding: Minimized from 5px → 3px between items
  - Icons: Compact 24x24 rectangles with clear type indicators
  - Headers: Shortened to 4-character abbreviations (HEAD, BODY, etc.)
  - Spacing: Minimal margins and section gaps

#### 📦 Complete Layout Overhaul
- **Responsive grid system**: Calculates optimal parts per row based on screen width
- **All parts visible**: No scrolling required, everything fits on screen
- **Enhanced part display**: 
  - Large letter indicator (H, B, A, L, P for each part type)
  - Part type abbreviation below
  - Color-coded by rarity (common=gray, rare=blue, epic=purple)
- **Improved interaction**: Container-based clicking with proper hover feedback

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ Eliminated all JavaScript errors in CraftScene
- ✅ Responsive layout that adapts to any screen size
